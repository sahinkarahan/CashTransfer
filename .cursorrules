Trailing whitespace should not be used.

# ArchitectureAndDesign

Use MVVM. Use the Core and Features structure. Create necessary folders.
Prefer Swift 6, iOS 18, and Xcode 16.2 features.
Use async/await for modern concurrency.
Prefer dependency injection.
Use the repository pattern.
Implement proper dependency injection.
Use SwiftUI, use UIKit only when necessary.
The service layer should be protocol-oriented.
Complex views should be broken into subviews (maximum 150 lines).
Prefer modular and iterative structures to avoid code duplication.

# UIAndUX

Use foregroundStyle instead of foregroundColor.
Add the Foundation, Swift, and SwiftUI libraries to the necessary files.
Ensure that all necessary libraries are added and confirm their inclusion.
Use clipShape(rect(CornerRadius:)) instead of CornerRadius.
Use NavigationStack instead of NavigationView.
Use @ViewBuilder when creating complex views.
Use SF Symbols for icons.
Provide support for Dark Mode and dynamic type.
Use SafeArea and GeometryReader for layout.
Support all screen sizes and orientations.
Implement proper keyboard handling.
Focus more on SwiftUI Animations to improve user experience.
Create a preview for every view.

# NamingAndStyle

Enum cases should use lowerCamelCase.
Struct and Class names should use UpperCamelCase.
Protocol names should end with -able, -ible, or Protocol.
Write view modifiers one per line.
Use camelCase for vars/functions, PascalCase for types.
Use verb forms for method names (e.g., fetchData).
Use prefixes is, has, should for Booleans.
Use clear, descriptive names following Apple's style.

# MemoryAndPerformance

Heavy operations should be done on a background thread.
Use Instruments for memory leak detection.
Implement pagination for large datasets.
Use LazyVStack/LazyHStack for large lists.
Sensitive data should be stored in the Keychain.
Perform necessary validations for API requests.
All network calls should be made using async/await.

# ErrorHandlingAndValidation

Do not use force unwrapping (!), prefer optional binding.
Use early returns to avoid long if blocks.
Handle errors using .alert.
Check for potential errors early in functions and handle them with early returns.
Use the Result type for errors.
Date formats should be localized.
Number formats should be localized.

# CodeStructureAndClarity

Use MARK to segment code.
Add explanations for complex algorithms.
Use protocol extensions for common code.
Use @Published, @StateObject for state management.
Use let over var.
Prefer value types (structs) over classes.
Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.
Use a strong type system and appropriate optionals.
Use @Environment for environment variables.
Define custom modifiers inside extensions.
Use LocalizedStringKey for all strings.

# DataAndSecurity

Store sensitive data in the Keychain.
Use CoreData for complex models.
Use SwiftData for preferences.
Follow a clean data flow architecture.
Apply proper dependency injection.
Implement proper data encryption for user data.
API keys should be added to .gitignore.
SSL pinning should be applied in the network layer.

# UIResponsiveness

Use .scaledFont for custom fonts.
Implement pagination for large datasets.
Support RTL (Right-to-Left) languages.

# CodeQualityAndMaintenance

Minimum iOS 18 support.
Follow the latest Swift features and protocol-oriented programming.
